Introduction to Github Actions

## About this project

This project introduce the use of Github actions to create workflows executing when we interact with a repository on Github.
It will prevent you to push on a mirror repository if some files that you created are unwanted files (e.g temp files)
or if the work you pushed doesn't work (doesn't compile or some tests failed).
With it, you ensure that your delivery repository is clean and that everything works as intended !

This project is made primarly for programs written in C at Epitech, but can be adapted for any type of language / project architecture.

## How to use

- Copy the chocolatine.yml file inside the .github/workflows of a Github repository
- Push something to the repository
- Profit !

# For Epitech Students : don't be too greedy ! This is an easy project, don't cheat !
